We will host meet ups and seminars regularly to teach the theories behind block chain  and Tron.
We will teach people, hand in hand, on how to use wallet to vote or  make transactions.
By talking with people, we can find out what is needed and how block chain can help improving everyone's life,make it more cost effective, quicker, more democratic. This will help us to serve the community better.

We will set up 12,000 Dollar scholarship, every year,  to be used in 4 Universities under the name TronCenter,  as long as we remain as SR.  So the young students will learn block chain theories and know what Tron will bring a huge change in the society. Also this will encourage more intelligent students to devote themselves to the block chain community. When more and more intelligent people get into this area, block chain will keep growing, becoming faster and easier to use, which will attract more users, then in return  more developers are needed. This produces a virtuous circle. 
 
We will product video tutorials on how to use Tron. Block chain is still in early age and lots of people don't understand it, which makes them unwilling to accept the new concepts. 
We believe, as pioneers, we have the responsibility to educate them and let them get rid of the fears. Social media is a great tool to fulfill our goal. As more and more people understand and participate,
more and more applications will be built and block chain industry will grow very fast.
 
Host hackathon on Dapp development on Tron. It is a great opportunity  to promote Tron.

Enhance the applications on our platform. This is our giving back to Tron community being a SR.
